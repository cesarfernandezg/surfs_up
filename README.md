# Overview of the Analysis
W. Avy wants to know the temperature data for June and December because he wants to know if the business is sustainable throughout the year.

# Results
Below is a table showing the temperatures for June and December:
| Temperature | June | December |
|-------------|------|----------|
| Minimum     | 64   | 56       |
| Maximum     | 85   | 83       |
| Average     | 75   | 71       |

As we can see, there is not much difference in temperature so we can infer that the business can be profitable throughout the year.
Also, the average temperature for both months indicates that there is a little fluctuation between the two months
The biggest difference is found in the minimum temperature: December (56), June (64), maybe this will have an impact in the ice cream business and maybe not many people want to surf with that temperature. Although the maximum temperature in December is also high, so the temperature in December is very variable. There will be good days and not so good days.

# Summary
Temperature in both months is very similar, December is very variant so it would be nice to crate a query with the precipitation in order to know which month has more rainy days.
Another query that would help is on the station to have a better insight on the temperatures and maybe in the coldest days they can offer a wetsuit to resist low temperatures.
